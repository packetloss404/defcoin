What is Defcoin?
----------------

Defcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that enables instant, low-cost payments
to anyone, anywhere in the world. Defcoin uses Scrypt proof-of-work with 2-minute
block times and a simple, predictable monetary policy.

**Key Features:**
- 2-minute block time (faster than Bitcoin/Litecoin)
- Scrypt proof-of-work algorithm
- 50 DFC initial block reward with halving schedule
- Based on Litecoin 0.21.x codebase for modern features

Defcoin Core is the reference implementation that enables the use of this currency.
